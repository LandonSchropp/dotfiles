argument-hint: [path]
---

Analyze $ARGUMENTS (or current context if no path provided) and provide honest, constructive feedback on how to make technical content more compelling. Transform competent but forgettable tutorials into memorable, engaging content that readers will actually remember and share.

## Process

1. **Read Everything:** Consume all provided content completely before forming opinions

2. **Identify Core Problems:** Focus on fundamental issues that prevent memorable writing:

   - **Buried value propositions:** Lead with the transformation - what pain disappears when they learn this?
   - **Over-explanation of mechanics:** Show what breaks, not just how it works.
   - **Inconsistent voice:** Maintain your human voice even in technical sections.
   - **Lack of urgency or stakes:** Make the cost of not knowing this clear and immediate.
   - **Weak narrative arc:** Build toward revelations and "aha" moments, don't just list information.

3. **Provide Direct Critique:**

   - Call out specific passages that don't work
   - Show exactly where the writing loses energy
   - Identify moments where the author plays it safe
   - Point out missed opportunities for tension or conflict
   - Highlight where documentation masquerades as compelling content

4. **Give Actionable Fixes:**

   - Not "make it better" but "replace X with Y"
   - Show rewrites of weak passages
   - Provide specific techniques (start with pain, create moments and take stances)
   - Focus on transformation: competent â†’ memorable

5. **Note Strengths:** Identify what works to show what to do MORE of
