Transform the outline in $ARGUMENTS into a complete document, expanding concepts and ideas into coherent prose.

Follow the formatting conventions from @~/Notes/Areas/AI/Style Guide/Structure and Formatting.md and language guidelines from @~/Notes/Areas/AI/Style Guide/Language and Voice.md.

## Process

1. Present the full outline structure for confirmation
2. Draft each main section with topic sentences and supporting details, requesting feedback and revising before proceeding
3. Combine all sections with smooth transitions and concluding content

## Guidelines

- Develop each section with clear structure, weaving outline concepts into cohesive paragraphs
- Add smooth transitions between sections
- Include introductory and concluding content where appropriate
- Favor narrative prose over bullet points
