Take the quick fragments, notes, or stream-of-consciousness content in $ARGUMENTS and expand them into well-organized, coherent writing. Ignore content that is already coherent and well-organized.

Apply the structure and formatting style guide from @~/Notes/Areas/AI/Style Guide/Structure and Formatting.md.

## Process

1. **Analyze fragments:** Identify key ideas and themes in the raw content
2. **Organize structure:** Group related ideas and create logical flow
3. **Expand content:** Develop fragments into complete thoughts and clear explanations
4. **Apply formatting:** Use proper structure and formatting conventions
