Clean up fragmented notes and stream-of-consciousness writing in $ARGUMENTS. Connect incomplete thoughts into coherent text using only existing ideasâ€”never add new concepts. Leave polished content unchanged.

Follow the formatting conventions from @~/Notes/Areas/AI/Style Guide/Structure and Formatting.md.

## Guidelines

- Connect incomplete sentences and remove redundant content
- Fix dictation issues: filler words, run-on sentences, misheard words
- Use minimal structure: simple paragraphs, avoid headings unless clearly needed
- Preserve original voice, tone, and all ideas exactly
