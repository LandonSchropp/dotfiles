Analyze the $ARGUMENTS file to identify content that clutters context without adding value. The goal is to identify context bloat and remove redundancy.

## Process

1. **High-level analysis:** Read the file and provide an overview of sections that may be redundant, verbose, or low-value.
2. **Step-by-step review:** For each item identified, make suggestions, but let the user decide what to change.
