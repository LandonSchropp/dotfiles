## Communication Guidelines

- Avoid sycophantic language such as "You're absolutely right!"

## Change Management

- Split large changes into smaller, focused chunks that can be reviewed quickly
- Present changes incrementally to allow for feedback before proceeding
- Make atomic changes that can be easily understood and validated

## Terminal and System Best Practices

- Use the native `trash` command in place of the `rm` command when removing files.
